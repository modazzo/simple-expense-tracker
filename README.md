This program is a PHP-based income and expense management tool. It provides the following functionalities:

Input of New Transactions: Users can enter new income or expense transactions through a form, including details such as description, amount, date, and an optional receipt.

Display of Transactions: A scrollable table with a fixed header displays the recorded transactions. Income amounts are shown in bold blue with a + prefix, while expenses are shown in bold red with a - prefix.

Editing Transactions: A modal dialog allows users to edit existing transactions by clicking the edit button in the table.

Deleting Transactions: Transactions can be removed using a delete button in the table.

Visualization and Navigation: The table is scrollable, and rows can be clicked to highlight them for better visibility.

The tool stores transactions in a JSON file and supports basic file uploads for receipts. It uses Bootstrap and JavaScript for a modern, interactive, and user-friendly interface.
